= Image Assertions =

The image assertion extensions allow you to specify declarative assertions
for the NetKernel Image resource model.

== Setup ==
To use the image assertions, you must import the module '''urn:org:netkernelroc:xunit'''.

{xml}
<import>
  <uri>urn:org:netkernelroc:xunit</uri>
</import>
{/xml}

and import the test library in your testlist document:

{xml}
<testlist>
  <import>res:/org/netkernelroc/netkernel/xunit/assertions/netkernelrocAssertLibrary.xml</import>
</testlist>
{/xml}

== Assertions ==

All image assertion tests can be specified within a single image assertion declaration. The valid tests
are:

* '''width''' - asserts the width of the image
* '''height''' - asserts the height of the image
* '''color''' - asserts the color at a specific pixel.  The format of the text is a json string: <nowiki>{"x":1,"y":1,"red":255, "green":255, "blue":255}</nowiki> where x and y are the coordinates of the pixel to be tested, and red, green, blue are in the range of 1 to 255.
* '''equals''' - asserts that the returned image is identical to the image specified as the test image.

Because the assertion test transforms images into a common java.awt.Image object, you can compare two images of different formats.
In the example below a a JPG is being compared to a PNG.


== Examples ==

An example test would look as follows:

{xml}
<testlist>
  <import>res:/org/netkernelroc/netkernel/xunit/assertions/netkernelrocAssertLibrary.xml</import>

  <test>
  <request>
    <identifier>res:/resources/image.jpg</identifier>
  </request>
  <assert>
    <image>
      <assertions>
        <width>100</width>
        <height>100</height>
        <color>{"x":1,"y":1,"red":255, "green":255, "blue":255}</color>
        <equals>res:/resources/image.png</equals>
      </assertions>
    </image>
  </assert>
  </test>
</testlist>
{/xml}

Because it internally reads the images into a java.awt.Image object, you can compare two images of different formats.
For example, in the above example, a JPG is being compared to a PNG.
