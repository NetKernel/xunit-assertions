{endpoint}netkernelroc:assert:RDF{/endpoint}



The Test list must import the test library:

{xml}
<testlist>
  <import>res:/org/netkernelroc/netkernel/xunit/assertions/netkernelrocAssertLibrary.xml</import>
</testlist>
{/xml}

An example test would look like this:

{xml}
<testlist>
  <import>res:/org/netkernelroc/netkernel/xunit/assertions/netkernelrocAssertLibrary.xml</import>

  <test>
  <request>
    <identifier>res:/myRDF</identifier>
  </request>
  <assert>
    <rdfTripleCount>40</rdfTripleCount>
  </assert>
  </test>
</testlist>
{/xml}

This test issues a request ...

The library contains one assertion for each standard response header as well
as the return code.
Each test can be for just the existence of the header information as
well as the specific contents.
When testing for the contents, the test first attempts a strict string
comparison and if that fails, it interprets the string as regular expression
and attempts the test again.

All assertions work the same way and some of them have detailed documentation below.


The library supplies the following additional assertions:

=== rdfTripleCount ===

The RDF representation can be examined for the total number of triple.
